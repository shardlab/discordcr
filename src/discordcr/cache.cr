module Discord
  # A cache is a utility class that stores various kinds of Discord objects,
  # like `User`s, `Role`s etc. Its purpose is to reduce both the load on
  # Discord's servers and reduce the latency caused by having to do an API call.
  # It is recommended to use caching for bots that interact heavily with
  # Discord-provided data, like for example administration bots, as opposed to
  # bots that only interact by sending and receiving messages. For that latter
  # kind, caching is usually even counter-productive as it only unnecessarily
  # increases memory usage.
  #
  # Caching can either be used standalone, in a purely REST-based way:
  # ```
  # client = Discord::Client.new(token: "Bot token", client_id: 123_u64)
  # cache = Discord::Cache.new(client)
  #
  # puts cache.resolve_user(66237334693085184) # will perform API call
  # puts cache.resolve_user(66237334693085184) # will not perform an API call, as the data is now cached
  # ```
  #
  # It can also be integrated more deeply into a `Client` (specifically one that
  # uses a gateway connection) to reduce cache misses even more by automatically
  # caching data received over the gateway:
  # ```
  # client = Discord::Client.new(token: "Bot token", client_id: 123_u64)
  # cache = Discord::Cache.new(client)
  # client.cache = cache # Integrate the cache into the client
  # ```
  #
  # Note that if a cache is *not* used this way, its data will slowly go out of
  # sync with Discord, and unless it is used in an environment with few changes
  # likely to occur, a client without a gateway connection should probably
  # refrain from caching at all.
