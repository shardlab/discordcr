    # Both of these things can be found on a bot's application page; the token
    # will need to be revealed using the "click to reveal" thing on the token
    # (**not** the OAuth2 secret!)
    #
    # If the *shard* key is set, the gateway will operate in sharded mode. This
    # means that this client's gateway connection will only receive packets from
    # a part of the guilds the bot is connected to. See
    # [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#sharding)
    # for more information.
    #
    # The *large_threshold* defines the minimum member count that, if a guild
    # has at least that many members, the client will only receive online
    # members in GUILD_CREATE. The default value 100 is what the Discord client
    # uses; the maximum value is 250. To get a list of offline members as well,
    # the `#request_guild_members` method can be used.
    #
    # `compress` can be set to any value of `CompressMode`. `CompressMode::Stream`
    # is the default and will save the most bandwidth. You can optionally change
    # this to `CompressMode::Large` to request that only large payloads be received
    # compressed. Compression can be disabled with `CompressMode::None`, but this
    # is not recommended for production bots.
    #
    # When using `Compress::Stream` compression, the buffer size can be configured
    # by passing `zlib_buffer_size`.
    #
    # The *properties* define what values are sent to Discord as analytics
    # properties. It's not recommended to change these from the default values,
    # but if you desire to do so, you can.
    #
    # The *intents* value is used to request that only specific events are sent
    # to this client for the current session. For details on what `Intents` values
    # correspond to which gateway events, see the [API docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-intents).
