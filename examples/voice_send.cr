    # For smooth audio streams Discord requires one packet every
    # 20 milliseconds. The `every` method measures the time it takes to run the
    # block and then sleeps 20 milliseconds minus that time before moving on to
    # the next iteration, ensuring accurate timing.
    #
    # When simply reading from DCA, the time it takes to read, process and
    # send the frame is small enough that `every` doesn't make much of a
    # difference (in fact, some users report that it actually makes things
    # worse). If the processing time is not negligibly slow because you're
    # doing something else than DCA parsing, or because you're reading from a
    # slow source, or for any other reason, then it is recommended to use
    # `every`. Otherwise, simply using a loop and `sleep`ing `20.milliseconds`
    # each time may suffice.

    #     voice_client.not_nil!.play_opus(frame)

    # block.)
