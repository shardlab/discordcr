If you feel\noverwhelmed by the complex documentation, try\n[discordrb](https://github.com/shardlab/discordrb) first and then check back.\n\nUnlike many other libs which handle a lot of stuff, like caching or resolving,\nthemselves automatically, discordcr requires the user to do such things\nmanually. It also doesn't provide any advanced abstractions for REST calls;\nthe methods perform the HTTP request with the given data but nothing else.\nThis means that the user has full control over them, but also full\nresponsibility. discordcr does not support user accounts; it may work but\nlikely doesn't.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this to your application's `shard.yml`:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  discordcr:\n    github: shardlab/discordcr\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nAn example bot can be found\n[here](https://github.com/shardlab/discordcr/blob/master/examples/ping.cr). More\nexamples will come in the future.\n\nA short overview of library structure: the `Client` class includes the `REST`\nmodule, which handles the REST parts of Discord's API; the `Client` itself\nhandles the gateway, i. e. the interactive parts such as receiving messages. It\nis possible to use only the REST parts by never calling the `#run` method on a\n`Client`, which is what does the actual gateway connection.\n\nThe example linked above has an example of an event (`on_message_create`) that\nis called through the gateway, and of a REST call (`client.create_message`).\nOther gateway events and REST calls work much in the same way - see the\ndocumentation for what specific events and REST calls do.\n\nCaching is done using a separate `Cache` class that needs to be added into\nclients manually:\n\n```cr\nclient = Discord::Client.new # ...\ncache = Discord::Cache.new(client)\nclient.cache = cache\n```\n\nResolution requests for objects can now be done on the `cache` object instead of\ndirectly over REST, this ensures that if an object is needed more than once\nthere will still only be one request to Discord. (There may even be no request\nat all, if the requested data has already been obtained over the gateway.)\nAn example of how to use the cache once it has been instantiated:\n\n```cr\n# Get the username of the user with ID 66237334693085184\nuser = cache.resolve_user(66237334693085184_u64)\nuser = cache.resolve_user(66237334693085184_u64) # won't do a request to Discord\nputs user.username\n```\n\nApart from this, API documentation is also available, at\n\nhttps://dcr.shardlab.dev/v0.4.0 for v0.4.0\n\nhttps://dcr.shardlab.dev/master for latest\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.

cache is a utility class that stores various kinds of Discord objects,\nlike `User`s, `Role`s etc. Its purpose is to reduce both the load on\nDiscord's servers and reduce the latency caused by having to do an API call.\nIt is recommended to use caching for bots that interact heavily with\nDiscord-provided data, like for example administration bots, as opposed to\nbots that only interact by sending and receiving messages. For that latter\nkind, caching is usually even counter-productive as it only unnecessarily\nincreases memory usage.\n\nCaching can either be used standalone, in a purely REST-based way:\n```\nclient = Discord::Client.new(token: \"Bot token\", client_id: 123_u64)\ncache = Discord::Cache.new(client)\n\nputs cache.resolve_user(66237334693085184) # will perform API call\nputs cache.resolve_user(66237334693085184) # will not perform an API call, as the data is now cached\n```\n\nIt can also be integrated more deeply into a `Client` (specifically one that\nuses a gateway connection) to reduce cache misses even more by automatically\ncaching data received over the gateway:\n```\nclient = Discord::Client.new(token: \"Bot token\", client_id: 123_u64)\ncache = Discord::Cache.new(client)\nclient.cache = cache # Integrate the cache into the client\n```\n\nNote that if a cache is *not* used this way, its data will slowly go out of\nsync with Discord, and unless it is used in an environment with few changes\nlikely to occur, a client without a gateway connection should probably\nrefrain from caching at all.","summary":"<p>A cache is a utility class
